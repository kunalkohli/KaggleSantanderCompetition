# KaggleSantanderCompetition

This code notebook was used to participate in kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction

In this competition we will identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. This approach uses a mixed model approach i.e. it uses a neural network (keras) and gradient boosted trees to predict if the transaction will be done or not.
